# Summerfield Lab Handbook and Wiki

Hello and welcome to the new version of our public-facing website!

This has not yet been deployed to humaninformationprocessing.com, but it is currently publicly viewable at [https://summerfieldlab.github.io/](https://summerfieldlab.github.io/)

One big advantage of the new site is that it is now editable in pure Markdown + YAML. Everyone in the lab has write access to this repository and can directly make changes as needed.

For complex changes like uploading images, etc., it's probably best to clone the git repository and push your changes that way.

For simple changes, like updating "first-year DPhil student" to "second-year DPhil student", you can simply go to the relevant page --
People's bios: [/_data/people.yml]https://github.com/summerfieldlab/summerfieldlab.github.io/blob/main/_data/people.yml
Lab publications: [/_data/publications.yml](https://github.com/summerfieldlab/summerfieldlab.github.io/blob/main/_data/publications.yml)
-- and edit it right in your browser by clicking the pencil icon in the upper-right hand corner.
